                <p>Welcome! I am a PhD Candidate in Economics at Northwestern University. My research is in health economics and applied microeconomics.</p>

                <div class="toggle-content">
                    <p>Differences between nonprofit and for-profit hospitals within the private US hospital market have been
a matter of longstanding theoretical and empirical interest in economics and are the subject of much
policy debate. Despite this, few prior works take a causal approach to examining the difference in
quality of care between these hospital types. I apply an instrumental variables strategy based on
ambulance preferences for individual hospitals (Doyle et al. 2015) to mitigate patient selection into
hospital types. I find that for-profit hospitals offer slightly worse care (5.7% higher readmissions) and
cause patients to experience higher costs (6.7%). These effects are not attenuated over time. Higher costs are likely driven in part by higher treatment intensity in the form of more frequent inpatient
admissions and longer stays.</p>

                <div class="toggle-content"><p>I assemble a dataset tracking the private equity ownership of hospitals in the US between 2002-2014.  I will use this data, in combination with Medicare claims data, to understand the impacts of private equity ownership of hospitals on qualtiy of care.  The empirical approach will harness ambulance preferences for hospitals (Doyle et al., 2015) to instrument for the onwership of the destination hospital of ambulance rides.</p></div>

                <p><strong>Vertical Integration and Provider Choice, with Xingyue Xin</strong> (<a href="coming_soon_copy.pdf" target="_blank">link</a>)</p>
                <p class="toggle-button" onclick="toggleContent(this)">Abstract</p>
                <div class="toggle-content"><p>In order to ultimately be matched with specialist healthcare providers who are the best fit for them,
patients may have to undergo a search process that involves switching providers. We examine the
impacts of vertical integration between primary care providers and specialist providers, whether in
hospital or practice settings, on the likelihood that diabetes patients switch endocrinologists. Vertical
integration may make it easier for patients to find the right endocrinologists by initially creating
higher-value matches (less switching). On the other hand, vertical integration may make it harder
by inducing referrals by primary care providers to integrated endocrinologists who may not be the
best fit (more switching). We implement two-way fixed-effects designs to examine the relationship
between vertical integration and the likelihood of seeing and switching providers. Preliminary results
suggest that patients with vertically-integrated primary care providers are more likely to see and
switch endocrinologists. Next steps involve exploring the relationship between switching and health
outcomes, as well as examining mechanisms for results so far.</p></div>

                <p><strong>School Finance Reforms and Birth Outcomes, with Sam Ayers</strong> (<a href="coming_soon_copy_2.pdf" target="_blank">link</a>)</p>
                <p class="toggle-button" onclick="toggleContent(this)">Abstract</p>
                <div class="toggle-content"><p>A series of school finance reform policies in the late 1900s aimed to reduce educational inequalities
across schools. Third-wave school finance reform policies implemented funding changes that were
intended to address inequalities in educational outcomes. Prior work (Rothstein and Schanzenbach,
2022) finds that these policies improved educational and labor market outcomes. We examine the
relationship between third-wave school finance reform policies and maternal and infant outcomes.
Estimates from an event-study design suggest that these policies did not impact maternal and infant
outcomes. For several outcomes, the confidence intervals include effect sizes comparable to those
estimated for other education policies and related treatments or other economically meaningful effects.</p></div>
